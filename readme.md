Pikomon Game Constraints
The creators of Pikomon have discovered that looking at their precious little mons isn’t enough for the average consumer. They want to do something with them!
Now they’ve hired you to design and implement the Pikomon card game as a web app.
Here are the rules:
Types
Each Pikomon comes in one of four types:
Plant, Bot, Rock, or Meat
Meat is strong against Plant
Plant is strong against Rock
Rock is strong against Bot
Bot is strong against Meat
Each Pikomon has an Attack value.
If a Pikomon is facing a type it is strong against, their Attack value is doubled.
